Hey! I am David and this is my personal, self-maintained website. I created this website mainly for publishing my research (but only the one related to my PhD topic), 
since often publishers allow an accepted manuscript to be
published on your personal website. Maybe I will additionally add some tutorials of stuff related to my work.
